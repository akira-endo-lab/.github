## Research
Our research aims to use mathematical modelling to better understand transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and inform control efforts.

Ongoing research projects include:
* Global mpox outbreaks (clade IIb, clade Ib)
* Seasonal influenza
* Respiratory syncytial virus
* Respiratory infections within schools and households
* Vaccine decision making
* Social and sexual contact behaviours
* Branching process models
